# Errata for *Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs*

On **page 51**:
 
Figure 2-3, as it appears in the book, doesn't quite match the figure 

caption. We have uploaded a revised version of the figure (Figure 2-3.JPG) 

that correctly matches the figure caption.

On **page 132**:
The following sentence references a variable (W) that is not present in 

the in Equation 4-3 or 4-4: "The previous optimization problem has only 

one objective, which is maximizing the profit. Another objective might be 

minimizing the wastepaper represented by Equation 4-3, where W represents 

the amount of wastepaper, with a range from 2 to 4 tons. As a result, the 

problem becomes a MOOP, as shown in Equation 4-4."

This is a small error that can be corrected by replacing X with W in both 

equations, making the new equation K=(Wâˆ’2)^2+1.
